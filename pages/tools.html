                    <p>A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on pre-established security rules.</p>
                    <p>Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet, preventing unauthorized access and protecting against malicious attacks.</p>

                    <p>An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations.</p>
